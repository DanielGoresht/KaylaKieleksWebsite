              <p>has really helped me understand who I am. When asked why I wanted to become a teacher, I struggled to answer because I never really thought about the reason. I knew I loved kids and I knew I would get to work with kids in a teaching profession. The more I thought about that question through out my field experience, the more reasons I had for why I knew I was meant to be a teacher. At first, I was eager to work with the students, but it turned into so much more. I started to realize how much of a difference having a good teacher could affect a student’s life. I want to help make a difference in kids’ lives and I can’t think of a better profession than teaching to accomplish that goal. I believe that students want to learn about the world around them. They want to be able to make connections between what they are learning in the classroom with real life experiences. </p>

              <p> As a teacher, I will strive to relate curriculum to life as well as be as flexible as possible with their learning. A lesson plan is not written in stone. I think it is important to be able to go with the flow and pay attention to the students to see where their learning is taking them. Sometimes a lesson will completely change focus and that is not necessarily a bad thing because your students could end up learning an even more valuable lesson. I hope to inspire students to dream big and learn how to achieve their dreams. I think that people these days are too focused on having job security or high paying jobs and it is rubbing off on kids. Kids need to know that they can accomplish anything if they work hard and focus. Without having this creativity and sense of wonder, the world would lose its fascination.</p>

              <p>I am there to support the students rather than just tell them everything they need to know. I think it's important to build strong relationships as a teacher. To have your students respect you, you need to show respect to them. Laughing with the students, having fun while teaching, and listening to a student when they need you is all part of building strong relationships in your classroom.</p>
